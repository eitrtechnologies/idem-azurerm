# Microsoft Azure Cloud Provider for Idem
Azure is a cloud service offered by Microsoft that provides virtual machines, SQL services, media services, and more.
Azure Resource Manager is the next generation of the Azure portal and API. This provider is a
[POP](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/pop) plugin and an extension of [Idem](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/idem),
allowing Idem users to leverage Microsoft Azure Resource Manager functionality to enforce the state of cloud
infrastructure, applications, configurations, and more.

## INSTALLATION
The azurerm idem provider can be installed via pip:
```
pip install idem-azurerm
```

## INSTALLATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
1. Clone the `idem-azurerm` repository.
2. Install requirements with pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Install `idem-azurerm` in "editable" mode:
```
pip install -e <path cloned repo>
```
You are now fully set up to begin developing additional functionality for this provider.

## CREDENTIALS
This provider requires that a dictionary populated with valid Azure credentials be passed via
[acct](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/acct).

The credentials can be stored in an arbitrarily named file, such as `myawesomecreds.yml`
```
#!yaml

azurerm:
  default:
    client_id: "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa"
    secret: "X2KRwdcdsQn9mwjdt0EbxsQR3w5TuBOR"
    subscription_id: "bbbbbbbb-bbbb-bbbb-bbbb-bbbbbbbbbbbb"
    tenant: "cccccccc-cccc-cccc-cccc-cccccccccccc"
```

In order to prepare the credentials file for use, the acct command can be run to encrypt the file with the Fernet
algorithm.
```
(env) $ acct myawesomecreds.yml
New encrypted file at: myawesomecreds.yml.fernet
The file was encrypted with this key:
71Gbz2oDSv40Er9YUFBJPzOjtCi6Z2-5niBHPekkvqs=
```

Now we have an encrypted file containing the credentials and a symmetric key for decryption. Since you have encrypted
the file with the key, you can now remove the original plaintext file.
```
(env) $ rm myawesomecreds.yml
```

All we have to do now is to tell idem where to get the file and key for acct. This information can be passed to acct on
the command line as parameters, but we will set up environment variables for the purposes of this tutorial.
```
(env) $ export ACCT_FILE="/path/to/myawesomecreds.yml.fernet"
(env) $ export ACCT_KEY="1Gbz2oDSv40Er9YUFBJPzOjtCi6Z2-5niBHPekkvqs="
```

## RESOURCE DEFINITION
After installation, the Azure Resource Manager Idem Provider execution and state modules will be accessible to the hub.

The following example uses an azurerm state module to ensure the existence of a resource group.

Let's call this file "mytest.sls"
```
Resource group exists:
  azurerm.resource.group.present:
    - name: idem
    - location: eastus
    - tags:
        organization: EITR Technologies
```

## TESTING AND BUILDING RESOURCES
Before you build the resources defined in the ".sls" file you may want to test what will happen when the state file is
run. To do this, run idem with the `--test` option.
```
(env) $ idem state mytest.sls --test
```
Once you determine that your state file with perform the intended operations, then you can build the defined resources
by running idem like so:
```
(env) $ idem state mytest.sls
```
