Version 4.0.0
=============

Get the Newest Azure API Functionality
**************************************
This release marked a huge effort to bring the Azure Python SDK versions up to a current release. Many of the modules
in ``idem-azurerm`` were ported over from Salt states which were written in 2017. Cloud moves fast and we found
ourselves unable to use some newer features. Shout out to `Ajnbro <https://github.com/Ajnbro>`_ for putting in the good
work!
